# Hotel-sql-powerbi
The hotel industry is highly competitive, with fluctuating market conditions influenced by location, seasonality, and customer preferences. To maintain profitability and identify growth opportunities, hotels must analyze their operational performance across various dimensions, such as city, room type, and month.
The key challenge is to extract actionable insights from hospitality data to optimize performance metrics such as:

Revenue: Total earnings from room bookings.

Occupancy %: Percentage of rooms occupied relative to total inventory.

Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR): Revenue generated per available room.

Realization %: Percentage of expected revenue achieved.

Average Daily Rate (ADR): Average revenue per occupied room.

Direct Sales to Non-Room Revenue (DSNR): Contribution of direct sales relative to non-room revenues.

The objective is to uncover areas where the hotel can improve its performance and maximize revenue potential by evaluating city-specific, room-type-specific, and seasonal trends.

 

Objectives

Level One Analysis: Identify high-level trends and patterns across key performance metrics segmented by city, room type, and month.
Level Two Analysis: Deep dive into problem areas or opportunities, focusing on metrics with significant deviations from benchmarks, historical performance, or industry standards.
Actionable Insights: Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize operational efficiency, pricing strategies, and market positioning.
 

Data Requirements

To perform the analysis effectively, the following data is required:

 

Operational Data:

Room inventory per city.

Booking details (room type, booking channel, length of stay.

Revenue Data:

Revenue from room bookings.

 

Performance Metrics:

Historical and current values for Revenue, Occupancy %, RevPAR, Realization %, ADR, and DSNR.

Timeframe:

Monthly data for at least the last 24 months to observe trends and seasonality.

Analytical Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

 

Examine data distributions and trends across key dimensions: City, Room Type, and Month.

Identify outliers, missing data, and anomalies.

 

Level One Analysis:

Calculate aggregate values for each performance metric by City, Room Type, and Month.

Generate visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, line graphs) to highlight high-performing and underperforming segments.

 

Level Two Analysis:

Conduct root cause analysis for identified outliers or deviations.

Analyze correlations between metrics (e.g., Occupancy % vs. ADR, RevPAR vs. Month).

Evaluate performance against industry benchmarks where applicable.

Forecasting:

 

Predict future trends using time-series analysis to support strategic planning.

Opportunity Assessment:

 

Identify underutilized room types or cities.

Highlight months with high potential for improved revenue or occupancy.
